# Snake Game

This Python application is a classic Snake game built using the Turtle library.

## Overview

The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake, guiding it to eat food pellets to grow longer. However, if the snake collides with itself or the game borders, it's game over.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**:
  - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
  - The snake continuously moves at a fixed speed.
  
- **Food Pellets**:
  - Food pellets appear at random positions on the screen.
  - When the snake eats a food pellet, it grows longer, and the score increases.

- **Scoring System**:
  - The game displays the current score.
  - Collisions with walls or the snake's own body result in the game ending.
